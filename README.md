# containers-orchestration
As there are many container orchestration tool, it becomes difficultto choose one. So we thought of taking one Real World App and deploy it in differnet orchestration engines. 



We thought a real world e-commerce platform would be a nice and came
across [Magento](https://magento.com/). While doing some browsing we 
came across [this blog post](http://mageinferno.com/blog/deploy-magento-2-digital-ocean-tutum)
to deploy Magento2 on Tutum., which gave us good reference. 

So first we would deploy Magneto on differnet orhestration engines and
then experiment with features like replication, auto-scaling etc.
